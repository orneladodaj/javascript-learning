# Objects
Javascript is prototype based objected oriented programming so we are working with objects that are based on prototypes
Prototype is like the blueprint that all toy robots are made from
Everytime a toy is made it inherits things from the factory

Every object in javascript gets some extra abilities because it follows a blueprint called Object.prototype
We can change the default abilities anytime we want

Classes work as templates for an object type
class followed by a capitalized name {}
class Name{}
const Name = class{}

The constructor defines parameters
constructor{}
